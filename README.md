# Guided Project

## App Store Data Research

### Introduction

The work that I've uploaded here forms part of the coursework for the Data Science track on Dataquest. It basically reinforces the topics learnt throughout the course and provides the opportunity to develop a methodology for data analysis and to begin developing a portfolio. 

### Project Information

The aim of this project is to analyze app store data from the Google Play and the App Store to determine what kind of app would be best to develop on a limited budget to be profitable.
